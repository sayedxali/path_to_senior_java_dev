- [x] JDBC
- [ ] Collection
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] File System
- [ ] Thread
- [ ] Reflection
- [ ] Lambda
- [ ] XML (SAX, DOM, JDOM, JAXB)

## Web Development

Ready to create amazing web applications with Java? The Web Development category is where you want to be! You'll learn how to use popular frameworks like Spring and Hibernate ORM, build RESTful web services, learning how to use Java Enterprise edition, and even explore modern frontend libraries like ReactJS and AngularJS.
### => Java EE
- [x] Dependency Injection (EJB 3.2, CDI 2)
- [x] JPA (Java Persistence API) with EJB
- [ ] JMS (Java Messaging Service) JSR 342 in Java EE8
- [ ] Web Service (JAX RS/WS - Restful/WSDL)
- [ ] Schedule (EJB Timer)
- [ ] Interceptor
After that, you can move on to:
- [ ] Test (JUnit 4.1, Arquillian 1.1.11)
- [ ] Batch Processing (JSR 352 - jbatch) in Java EE8
- [ ] JavaMail API (JSR 919)
- [ ] Report Generation pdf by Scala (use webkti)
- [ ] Create custom HTTP Servlet with XML and JSON parser, upload and download, serializer, deserializer
- [ ] Web Socket(JSR 356 - Tyrus framework) in Java EE8
- [ ] Application Server (Glassfish 5, Payara 171.1 , TomEE 1.7)

### => Spring framework
For Spring framework, the recommended order is:
- [x] Spring Boot
- [x] Spring MVC
- [x] Spring Thyme leaf
- [x] Spring Data JPA
- [x] Spring Mail Service
- [x] Spring Test (Mock & Smoke By Junit5 - TDD & BDD)
- [x] Spring Security (JWT, - oauth2)
- [x] Spring Validation
After that, you can move on to:
- [ ] Reactive Programming
- [ ] Spring Webflux
- [ ] Spring Web MVC by Webflux
- [ ] Spring WebSocket by Webflux
- [ ] Spring Security by Webflux (jwt, oauth2-client)
- [ ] Spring WebClient by Webflux
- [ ] Spring WebSocketClient by Webflux
- [ ] Spring RsocketServer (TCP, WebSocket)
- [ ] Spring RsocketClient (rsocketrequester)
- [ ] Spring Rsocket Security(jwt, basic)
- [ ] Spring ActiveMQ (message broker)
- [ ] Spring Swagger
- [ ] Spring Data Reactive MongoDB
- [ ] Spring Data Reactive MongoGridFs
- [ ] Spring Cache
- [ ] Spring Slf4j
- [ ] Spring Retry
- [ ] Spring AOP (AspectJ)
- [ ] Spring Actuator
- [ ] Microservices

## Testing

Testing is a critical part of any software development process, and the Testing category has got you covered with everything you need to know about testing methodologies and tools in Java development. From unit testing with JUnit to Test-Driven Development (TDD), you'll be able to write high-quality code that works flawlessly every time.
- [x] Unit Testing with JUnit
- [ ] Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Performance Testing
- [x] Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- [x] Behavioral-Driven Development (BDD)

## Database

Databases are an essential part of any application, which is why we've included the Database category in this roadmap. You'll learn about relational and NoSQL databases, how to design efficient database schemas, and write optimized queries that keep your applications running smoothly.
- Relational Databases (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL)
- NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)

## DevOps

In today's fast-paced world, DevOps is becoming increasingly important in Java development. That's why we've included a section on DevOps, where you'll learn about tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. With this knowledge, you'll be able to automate the entire software development lifecycle and deliver applications faster than ever before.
- [ ] Git
- [ ] Jenkins or Travis CI
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] AWS or Google Cloud


## Conclusion

Becoming a senior Java developer is an exciting journey, and I hope this roadmap will help you get there faster! Remember to take it one step at a time, and don't forget to have fun along the way. Good luck, and happy coding!
